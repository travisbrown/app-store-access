A set of [Rust][rust] libraries for working with the Google and Apple app stores.

## Overview

This project includes four pieces for each of the Google and Apple app store APIs:

1. An API client.
2. A data model representing API requests and responses as Rust definitions.
3. A data store for collecting requests and responses.
4. A command-line tool for making requests and saving API interactions to the data store.

It does not include any kind of index for the data.

At some point these four pieces will probably be split out into three separate packages, but while
the project is under active development, there are only three packages in total in this repository
(one for shared code, and one for each app store).

## Limitations

This project is under active development, and deserialization is designed to fail fast. If for
example a Google Play API response includes an unknown review criterion field, the response will be
saved to the data store, and the operation will then fail with an error. This approach is intended
to promote quick iteration, so that we know immediately when the API is returning data that we
haven't modeled, and can update our models.

## Quick start

You will need to have [installed][rust-installation] Rust and Cargo on your system for
anything in this repository to work.

First you need to build the project:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

Then you can run commands:

```bash
$ target/release/apple-scraper -vvv api search --query chess

Most commands will save a record of the request and response to `data/apple` or `data/google`.
The autocomplete suggestion commands are an exception, since in both cases they are treated
differently by the APIs (for example the Apple API returns a p-list instead of JSON).

Most commands will print a summary of the response to standard out as comma-separated rows.
This output is intended primarily for spot-checking and quick reference. In most cases you should
be working with the data by ingesting the contents of the `data` directories into an index (not
provided in this repository).

Note that the options and CSV output for the two platforms are not identical. For example
every Google request requires both a country and a language (possibly provided as an implicit
default), but this is not the case for Apple. In the output above, you can see that the Apple
app rows include both a numeric ID and a "bundle ID" (a reverse domain name), while Google apps
only have a single ID (formatted as a reverse domain name).
